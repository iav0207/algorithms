# Algorithms

### The course
This is the implementation of the assignment from the online course _Algorithms, Part I_ by Bob Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
To learn about the course follow the link below.

### The project
The project is divided by parts and weeks - just like the course - and contains
implementations of programming tasks and some exercises I do on my own while learning
lecture material.

## Task one: Percolation

### Specification
The program solves a percolation problem and measures probability threshold for the percolation system
via Monte Carlo simulation.
A brief model description and simulation details can be seen at the page:

## Task two: Queues

### Specification
The code implements Deque and Randomized queue data structures.
Also, there is an executable Permutation program, returning given strings
in random order.
