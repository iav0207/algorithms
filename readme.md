# Algorithms

### The course
This is the implementation of the assignment from the online course _Algorithms, Part I_ by Bob Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
To learn about the course follow the link below.

### The project
The project is divided by parts and weeks - just like the course - and contains
implementations of programming tasks and some exercises I do on my own while learning
lecture material.

## Task one: Percolation

### Specification
The program solves a percolation problem and measures probability threshold for the percolation system
via Monte Carlo simulation.
A brief model description and simulation details can be seen at the page:
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

## Task two: Queues

### Specification
The code implements Deque and Randomized queue data structures.
Also, there is an executable Permutation program, returning given strings
in random order.
A description can be seen at the page:
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html

## Task three: Collinear points

### Specification
The program recognizes line patterns in a given set of points, e.g. given a set of _n_ distinct
points in the plane, the algorithm finds every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset
of 4 or more of the points.
For more detail description refer to
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear.html

## Task four: 8-Puzzle

### Specification
The program solves the 8-puzzle and its n-by-n-generalization problem using the A*-search algorithm.
The implementation uses Priority Queue data structure to build a search tree for the problem solving.
